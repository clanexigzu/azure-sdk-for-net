The novel tells the story of Rangan, a middle-aged man who is haunted by his past and struggles to cope with his present. Rangan was born into a Brahmin family that followed the tradition of rishi moolam, which means that the eldest son of the family should renounce worldly life and become a sage. Rangan was forced to undergo this ritual when he was a child, but he escaped from the forest and returned to his family. However, he could not fit into the society that rejected him as an outcast. He became an alcoholic and a womanizer, and married a woman who did not love him. He also had an affair with his cousin, who bore him a son.
 
The novel explores Rangan's inner turmoil and his quest for identity and meaning in life. It also depicts the social and cultural changes that took place in Tamil Nadu in the 20th century, such as the rise of Dravidian politics, the decline of Brahminical hegemony, and the emergence of new forms of art and literature. The novel is rich in symbolism and imagery, and uses a stream-of-consciousness technique to portray Rangan's thoughts and emotions.
